This project implements a classic Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics. Players control a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food to grow longer while avoiding walls and collisions with itself. The game tracks the score and highest score, providing a simple and engaging experience. The score and high score are saved to a file, allowing them to persist between game sessions. The food appears at random locations on the screen, encouraging players to maneuver the snake to collect it. The snake moves smoothly and can change direction based on player input.
